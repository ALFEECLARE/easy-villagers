This mod lets you pick up villagers as an item.
There are also blocks that substitute every farm that includes villagers.
 
## The Villager Item

The villager item can be obtained by sneaking and right-clicking a villager.

## The Trader Block

The trader block allows to trade with the villager without having to deal with securing the villager. 
This block also allows the villager to restock in non working hours.

## The Farmer Block

The farmer block contains a whole crop farm in a single block. This helps to reduce lag and save space.

## The Breeder Block

The breeder block produces baby villagers by putting in food. This also helps to reduce lag, save space and also a lot of frustration.

## The Converter Block

The converter block converts villagers to zombie villagers and cures them afterwards, enabling the player that placed the block better trades from the cured villager. 
This block needs a golden apple, any type of potion of weakness and the villager to convert. 
This process takes approximately five minutes.

## The Iron Farm Block

The iron farm block contains a complete iron farm in a single block. 
It produces one iron golem every four minutes. 
This averages about one iron ingot per minute.

You can take stuff out of these blocks, by sneaking and right-clicking the block with an empty hand. 

Baby villagers are able to grow up inside of blocks, but the functionality of the blocks will not work until they are grown.

All blocks keep their stuff inside if they are broken.
